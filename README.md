## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on similarity in genre, director, cast, year, and ratings
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on users with similar preferences using Pearson correlation
- **Hybrid Algorithm**: Combines both approaches with weighted scoring (60% content, 40% collaborative)
- **Genre-Based Recommendations**: Browse top-rated movies by genre
- **Intelligent Search**: Search movies by title, director, cast, or genre
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by genre, year range, minimum rating, and director

### Frontend Features
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive design with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- **Interactive Movie Cards**: Hover effects, ratings display, and detailed information
- **Tabbed Interface**: Seamless navigation between browse, recommendations, and genre sections
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Instant results with loading states and smooth transitions
- **SEO Optimized**: Proper meta tags and semantic HTML structure

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: CSS variables with HSL color system

## 📊 Recommendation Algorithms

### 1. Content-Based Filtering
Analyzes movie attributes with weighted scoring:
- **Genre overlap** (40%): Measures shared genres between movies
- **Director similarity** (20%): Exact match for same director
- **Cast overlap** (20%): Counts shared actors
- **Year proximity** (10%): Movies from similar time periods
- **Rating similarity** (10%): Similar IMDB ratings

### 2. Collaborative Filtering
Uses Pearson correlation coefficient to find users with similar preferences:
- Calculates similarity between users based on common movie ratings
- Recommends movies highly rated by similar users
- Filters out movies already seen by the target user

### 3. Hybrid Approach
Combines both algorithms:
- 60% weight for content-based recommendations
- 40% weight for collaborative filtering
- Provides more accurate and diverse suggestions

## 🗃️ Dataset

The project uses a simulated IMDB dataset with 15 top-rated movies including:
- The Shawshank Redemption (1994)
- The Godfather (1972)
- The Dark Knight (2008)
- Pulp Fiction (1994)
- Forrest Gump (1994)
- And more classic films...

Each movie includes:
- Title, year, genre(s), director, cast
- IMDB rating and vote count
- Runtime and description
- Unique identifier for recommendations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Available Scripts

- `npm run build` - Build for production  
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## 💡 How to Use

### 1. Browse Movies
- View top-rated movies on the main page
- Use the search bar to find specific movies, directors, or actors
- Apply filters for genre, year range, and minimum rating

### 2. Get Recommendations
- Click on any movie card to select it
- Navigate to the "Recommendations" tab
- View three types of recommendations:
  - **Hybrid AI**: Most accurate combined approach
  - **Content-Based**: Similar movies by attributes
  - **Collaborative**: Based on user preferences

### 3. Browse by Genre
- Use the genre dropdown to explore specific categories
- View top-rated movies in each genre
- Apply additional filters to refine results

## 🎯 Algorithm Performance

### Content-Based Filtering
- **Strengths**: Works well for new movies, doesn't require user data
- **Approach**: Feature similarity calculation with weighted attributes
- **Use Case**: Find movies similar to a specific title

### Collaborative Filtering  
- **Strengths**: Discovers diverse recommendations, learns from user behavior
- **Approach**: Pearson correlation between users
- **Use Case**: Recommend based on community preferences

### Hybrid Algorithm
- **Strengths**: Best of both worlds, higher accuracy
- **Approach**: Weighted combination of both methods
- **Use Case**: Most comprehensive recommendations

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Real Dataset Integration**: Connect to actual IMDB or TMDB API
- **User Accounts**: Personal rating history and preferences
- **Advanced ML**: Neural networks, matrix factorization
- **Social Features**: Share recommendations, create watchlists
- **Performance**: Caching, lazy loading, pagination
- **Analytics**: Track recommendation effectiveness
